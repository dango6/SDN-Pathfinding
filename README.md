# SDN-Pathfinding


###### PROJECT DESCRIPTION ######

In this project, I am going to explore how object oriented programming and graph theory algorithms 
can be applied to accomplish network pathfinding goals such as routing and loop prevention in a 
software defined network

This project will allow me to combine my CCNA and computer science knowledge. This combination is
an area of significant interest for me, especially considering the ubiquity of software defined networks
as well as their importance in ever-increasing network complexity.

Not only will this project allow me to learn about how my existing knowledge of networking and programming
can be intersected to great effect, but it will provide a foundation for Cisco DevNet, a certification that
I plan on pursuing in the future

###### First Steps #######

1. Set Up Git Repository:

Created and accessed a new Git repository for the project via WSL
Added POX controller as a submodule to the repository

2. Configured Environment:

Verified that the Git repository and POX submodule are accessible in WSL
Ensured Python and Mininet are installed in the WSL environment

3. Installed Mininet:
